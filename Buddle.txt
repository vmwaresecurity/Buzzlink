PRESS SECRETARY JOHN F. KIRBY: Good afternoon, everybody. OK. Just one quick note at the top. Today, I think, as you all saw following the NATO heads of state and government approval of defense plans, the NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, General Wolters, released a statement, I think you've all seen this on the activation of the NATO Response Force. 

There's a historic nature to all this. This is the first time that the alliance has employed these high readiness forces in a deterrence and defense role. So, it's not an insignificant move by the Alliance. This activation serves as an additional notice or Warning Order, as you guys are familiar with, for the Allies who contribute to the NATO Response Force. 

I'm not going to have specifics for you today, on units, timelines, schedules, as NATO communicates what it's going to need from the United States, just like it will to other nations. And as they do that, we will certainly be able to acknowledge and announce those U.S. capabilities in units, who will be going specifically as designated to support the NATO mission and the NATO Response Force. 

Now, as we've also announced previously, the department has placed a range of multi-mission units in the United States in Europe on a heightened preparedness to deploy. Which increases our readiness to provide for the U.S. contributions to the NRF on a shorter tether than what we could do before. With today's activation notice by General Wolters, we stand ready if called upon by NATO, to support the NRF and the defense of the Alliance and will absolutely do that. And with that, Iâ€™ll take questions. Bob.
